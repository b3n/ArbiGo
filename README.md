# ArbiGo
Work in progress
<hr>

ArbiGo will be an implementation of Go that can be played on any board, the rules are:

0. The game is played on a finite graph.
1. Each player is assigned a discrete colour.
2. Play is alternate colouring of a non-coloured node.
3. A play of a colour causes loss of the other colours of all nodes without a path along the other colours to no colour and subsequently causes a loss of the colour of all nodes without a path along the colour to no colour.
4. No colouring after a play and its caused losses may be recreated.

These rules are based on graph theory. Unlike traditional rulesets they donâ€™t specify the kind of board to play on, the number of players, the colours, or even passes and how to win. The result is a variant of go that can be played on any board, with any number of players, and play continues until there are no legal moves left (or the other players forfeits).
